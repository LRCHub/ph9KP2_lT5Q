Everytime we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that i get
But i haven't missed you yet
Every room-mate
kept awake
By every silent scream we make
All the feelings that i get
But i still don't miss you yet

Only when i stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
why do i love you
I hate everything about you
why do i love you

everytime we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i haven't missed you yet

only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
why do i love you
I hate everything about you
why do i love you

only when i stop to think about you,
I know
only when you stop to think about me,
do you know

I hate everything about you
why do I love you
you hate everything about me
why do you love me

I hate
you hate
I hate
you love me

I hate everything about you
why do I love you
