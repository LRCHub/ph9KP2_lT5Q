everytime we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that I get
but I haven't missed you yet
every room mate kept awake
by every sigh
and scream we make
all the feelings that I get
but I still don't miss you yet
only when I stop
to think about it
I hate everything about you
why do I love you
I hate everything about you
why do I love you
<♪>

to think about it
I hate everything about you
why do I love you
I hate everything about you
why do I love you
only when I stop
to think about you
I know
only when you stop
to think about me
do you know
<♪>
I hate everything about you
why do I love you
you hate everything about me
why do you love me
I hate
you hate
I hate
you love me
I hate everything about you
why do I love you
